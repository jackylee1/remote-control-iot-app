LightsRemote iOS app is used as a remote for lights manipulation. Please, find project detailes on https://www.predic8.de/iot-mqtt-raspberry-pi-remotes.htm

LightsRemote sends messages to the broker to switch the lights on/off over the MQTT protocol. When the broker publishes a message to LightsRemote, its interface is updated accordingly.

To start using the app, connect it to the running broker. Then in the central "Lights" tab you can control lights by selecting the room that you want.
